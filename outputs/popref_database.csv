An Act Relating to Management of Game,Ballot Measure No. 6,2000,General,53,"Voters are asked to either approve or reject a law allowing hunters to use airplanes to land and shoot wolves on the same day they fly.  The law allows any person with a hunting or trapping license to land and shoot in areas established by the Board of Game.  No additional permit may be required.  The law also allows the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to use agents, as well as employees, to engage in same day airborne shooting of wolves.  A yes vote rejects the law.  A no vote approves the law.

History:  In 1996, Alaska voters passed an initiative which banned land-and-shoot wolf hunting.  The initiative was overturned in the 2000 legislative session with the passage of SB 267.  Measure 6 seeks to overturn the Legislature's action, thus re-enacting the ban on land-and-shoot wolf hunting."
