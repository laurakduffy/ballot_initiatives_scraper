Permits and Protection Standards for Alaska Salmon Initiative,Ballot Measure No. 1,2018,General,36.6,"This act would amend Alaska’s fish habitat permitting law and would require the Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) to issue permits for activities and development projects that have the potential to harm fish habitat. The act would exempt existing projects, operations, or facilities that have received all state and federal permits and would also create fish and wildlife habitat-protection standards. These standards would address water quality, temperature, stream flow, and more for anadromous fish habitat. The act would provide for three types of permits for development in anadromous fish habitat. The act would require ADF&G to avoid or minimize adverse effects through mitigation measures and permit conditions. It would provide public notice on all permits and a chance to comment on major permits and would also require ADF&G to deny a permit if the proposed activity would cause substantial damage to fish habitat. The act would create criteria, time frames, and an appeals process for the permits."
Personal Consumption of Fish and Game,Initiative 80-08,1982,General,41.6,"This proposal would, for fishing, hunting, or trapping for personal consumption, prevent classification of persons on the basis of economic status, land ownership, local residency, past use or dependence on the resource, or lack of alternative resources. It would, as does existing law, also bar classifications by race or sex for any taking of fish or game. It repeals existing provisions of the Fish and Game Code which provide for, or relate to, subsistence hunting and fishing."
Prohibiting Bear Baiting or Feeding,Ballot Measure 3,2004,General,43.3,"This bill would make it illegal for a person to bait or intentionally feed a bear to hunt, photograph, or view a
bear. A person could not feed a bear on purpose or use any item or substance, including food or other edible matter to entice a bear into an area, or to stay in an area.

Relating to same day airborne hunting of certain animals,Ballot Measure No. 3,1996,General,58.5,"This bill would bar hunting wild wolf, wolverine, fox, or lynx the same day a person was airborne. However, the board of game could allow aerial wolf control if the Commissioner of Fish and Game declared a biological emergency, where wolves in a specific area were causing irreversible loss of a prey population. The Law wouldn't apply to people airborne the same day on regular, scheduled commercial flights. Breaking the law would be a misdemeanor. The penalty could be jail time up to one year, a fine up to $5,000, and forfeiture of aircraft or gear used in the offense.

Fair Gaming Act,Proposition 201,2002,General,20.1,"Analysis by Legislative Council:

Proposition 201 allows racetracks conducting live horse and dog racing to operate slot machines and authorizes the Governor to enter into tribal gaming compacts allowing Indian tribes to operate slot machines and card and table games on tribal land. Racetracks would pay 40% of their ""gross gaming revenue"" (defined as the difference between gaming wins and losses, before deducting costs and expenses) from the operation of slot machines to the state to fund racing and agricultural programs, reading programs for kindergarten through third grade students, programs to provide medical assistance in rural areas and reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients, scholarships, statewide tourism, programs for problem gambling, local government programs to provide enhanced police, fire and emergency services, and to the state fund used for the general operation of state government. Tribes that compact to conduct house-banked blackjack or house-banked poker, or that elect to transfer unused slot machines would contribute 8% of their ""gross gaming revenue"" to the state fund used for the general operation of state government.

Arizona has entered into gaming compacts with 17 of the state's 21 Indian tribes. These compacts permit the tribes to operate specific gaming activities, including slot machines, that are, according to a federal court decision on appeal, illegal off of Indian reservations. These compacts begin to expire in the summer of 2003.

State law currently allows wagering on horse and dog racing at facilities that have state permits. State law does not presently allow horse and dog tracks to offer slot machines.
Proposition 201 allows the operation of slot machines at racetracks and authorizes the Governor to enter into new gaming compacts with Indian tribes as follows:

Term
· Racetracks--Each racetrack permittee must have a license to conduct live horse or dog racing before they may operate slot machines. The license is subject to renewal every 3 years and is revocable at anytime for cause. In addition, continued operation of slot machines will be subject to legislative review of the Arizona Department of Racing and the Arizona Racing Commission. State agencies undergo a complete review every 10 years and are subject to legislative oversight between reviews.
· Gaming compacts - 10 years.

Facilities
· Racetracks - Up to 10 racetracks statewide and up to 2 racetracks in a single county could operate slot machines.
· Gaming compacts - Each tribe may operate 1 to 3 gaming facilities, depending on tribal enrollment.

Games
· Racetracks - A maximum of 6450 slot machines at racetracks statewide would be allowed. The maximum number of slot machines at a single track would range from 550 to 950, depending on how many live races the track offers. This amount will increase every 5 years based on changes in the state's population.
· Gaming compacts - Tribes may offer slot machines, blackjack, poker, wagering on horse and dog races, raffles and bingo. Each tribe may operate 600 to 2400 slot machines, depending on tribal enrollment. A maximum of 1000 slot machines is allowed at a single facility. A tribe that elects expansion of terms found in existing compacts may offer blackjack and poker at 50 to 75 tables per facility, depending on how close the facility is to a heavily populated city.  Additionally, if the tribe elects expansion of terms found in existing compacts, the tribe may contract with another tribe to operate that tribe's slot machines and pay not less than 50% of the net win to the other tribe. The number of slot machines allowed adjusts every 5 years based on changes in the state's population. The Governor and each tribe may renegotiate the number of gaming tables allowed at that time.

Transfer provisions
· Racetracks - There are no provisions for racetracks to transfer their slot machine allotments to other tracks.
· Gaming compacts - Tribes may transfer a portion or all of their slot machine allotments to other tribes; a transferring tribe will receive not less than 50% of the net win from the transferred slot machines.

Revenue
· Racetracks - Tracks must pay 40% of their gross gaming revenue from the operation of slot machines to the state. Monies would be distributed to numerous racing and agricultural programs, to reading programs for kindergarten through third grade students, to provide medical assistance in rural areas and reduce the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients, to provide scholarships, to promote statewide tourism, to combat problem gambling, to cities to provide enhanced police, fire and emergency services and to the state general fund.
· Gaming compacts - Tribes electing expansion of terms found in existing compacts must contribute 8% of their gross gaming revenue to the state in return for the exclusive right to operate house-banked card games such as blackjack and housebanked poker games and to operate transferred slot machines from other tribes up to the limit of 1000 slot machines per casino. Monies go to the state general fund.  Pursuant to current law, tribes will continue to pay their share of regulatory costs incurred by the state.

Disclosure
· Racetracks - Tracks must disclose gross gaming revenue from each racetrack and each gaming activity. This information is open for public inspection at the Arizona Department of Racing.
· Gaming compacts - Each tribe must disclose to the Arizona Department of Gaming its gross gaming revenue for each facility and each gaming activity and its contributions to the state. This information is open for public inspection.

Regulation
· Racetracks - The Arizona Racing Commission must adopt rules setting forth standards for inspecting slot machines and monitoring their use, surveillance, record keeping and reporting requirements and standards for background investigations and licensure of employees. The racetracks would continue to be subject to annual audits.
· Gaming compacts - Compacts must establish standards for investigation, licensing and certification of gaming employees and persons who provide gaming goods or services by tribes and the state, must require minimum standards and operating procedures for gaming, must authorize audits and inspections of gaming facilities by the Arizona Department of Gaming and enforcement by the Department of compact terms, must establish technical specifications and testing and inspection procedures for slot machines and must establish surveillance requirements.

Results of Statewide Expansion of Gambling - Any changes to state law to allow expansion of gambling must be enacted by the voters.

Relating to Cruel and Inhumane Confinement of Animals,Proposition 204,2006,General,62.0,"ANALYSIS BY LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

Beginning January 1, 2013, Proposition 204 would amend the Arizona criminal code to make it a class 1 misdemeanor to tether or confine a pig during pregnancy or a calf raised for veal on a farm for all or the majority of a day in a manner that prevents the animal from lying down and fully extending its limbs or turning around freely. The law would not apply to:

1. Pigs or calves during transportation.

2. Pigs or calves in rodeo exhibitions, state or county fair exhibitions or other similar exhibitions.

3. The lawful slaughter of pigs or calves.

4. Pigs or calves involved in lawful scientific or agricultural research.

5. Pigs or calves while undergoing an examination, test, treatment or operation for veterinary purposes.

6. A pig during the seven day period before the pig's expected date of giving birth.

Proposition 204 would tentatively establish an enforcement and administration fund consisting of fines, penalties and other monies generated by the enforcement of this proposition and donations made to the fund. This fund would only be fully implemented if a court ultimately determined that creation of this fund is required by a separate state law dealing with the funding of programs created by a vote of the people.

FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT

State law requires the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC) Staff to prepare a summary of the fiscal impact of certain ballot measures. State and local governments may receive additional revenues in the form of fines and penalty assessments from violators of provisions of Proposition 204. The language of the proposition states that the measure does not impose mandatory expenditure of state revenues for any purpose. If, however, a court rules that the proposition results in mandatory expenditure of state revenue, a Humane Treatment of Farm Animals Fund is established and funded through enforcement related revenue and donations. The total amount of fines will depend on the level of compliance, which is difficult to predict in advance.

The Arkansas Animal Cruelty Act,Proposed Initiated Act 1,2002,General,38,"What does this proposed act do?

- The act amends current law to create an act of *aggravated animal cruelty,* a Class D Felony (punishable by up to 6 years in prison and/or a $10,000 fine for a first offense and up to 40 years in prison depending on the number of prior or subsequent felony convictions). The act defines *aggravated animal cruelty* as when a person knowingly tortures, mutilates, maims, burns, poisons, or maliciously kills, starves, or disfigures animals. It leaves unaltered the current Class A Misdemeanor penalties (punishable by up to $1,000 in fines and up to one year in prison) with the exception that it links subsequent Class A Misdemeanor animal cruelty convictions to classify the second offense as a Class D Felony. Felony convictions also carry with them the loss of certain rights commonly taken for granted by citizens. Included are the rights to vote, hold public elected office and own or possess a firearm of any kind. Other fines and costs are linked to court authorized care and keeping of abused animals and psychological care and counseling for those convicted as required by the court.
- It changes the current statute prohibiting *dog* fighting to prohibit *animal* fighting and to further prohibit manufacture or sale of animal fighting equipment, supporting animal fighting, being present at an animal fight presented as a public spectacle or owning/possessing devices with the intent of using such device for animal fighting or to enhance an animal*s fighting ability.  
• The act enables forfeiture of animals that are deemed abused or mistreated in the eyes of the court and specifies the disposition of the animals seized by the court. The statute also sets limits for notice and claims of interest in an animal seized under the Animal Cruelty Act authority (at least 41 days from the date of first publishing the court order). This provision in the act allows the court to take possession of an animal even prior to trial if a preponderance of evidence is established to indicate an act of cruelty or aggravated animal cruelty. This court action can be taken in advance of a person*s conviction or acquittal on either charge of Misdemeanor or Felony Animal Cruelty. This *Statutory Lien* provision in the act is a change from existing law.

Standards for Confining Farm Animals.  Initiative Statute.,Proposition 2,2008,General,63.5,"BACKGROUND
Animal agriculture is a major industry in California. Over 40 million animals are raised for commercial purposes on California farms and ranches. California’s leading livestock commodities are milk and other dairy products, cattle, and chickens.

In recent years, there has been a growing public awareness about farm animal production methods, and how these practices affect the treatment of the animals. In particular, concerns have been expressed about some animal farming practices, including the housing of certain animals in confined spaces, such as cages or other restrictive enclosures.

Partly in response to these concerns, various animal farming industries have made changes in their production practices. For example, certain industries have developed guidelines and best practices aimed, in part, at improving the care and handling of farm animals.

State law prohibits cruelty to animals. Under state law, for example, any person who keeps an animal confined in an enclosed area is required to provide it with an adequate exercise area, and permit access to adequate shelter, food, and water. Other laws specifically related to farm animals generally focus on the humane transportation and slaughter of these animals. Depending upon the specific violation, an individual could be found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both.

PROPOSAL
Beginning January 1, 2015, this measure prohibits with certain exceptions the confinement on a farm of pregnant pigs, calves raised for veal, and egg-laying hens in a manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. Under the measure, any person who violates this law would be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or imprisonment in county jail for up to six months.

FISCAL EFFECTS
Compared to current practice most commonly used by California farmers in the affected industries, this measure would require more space and/or alternate methods for housing pregnant pigs, calves raised for veal, and egg-laying hens. As a result, this measure would increase production costs for some of these farmers. To the extent that these higher production costs cause some farmers to exit the business, or otherwise reduce overall production and profitability, there could be reduced state and local tax revenues. The magnitude of this fiscal effect is unknown, but potentially in the range of several million dollars annually.

Additionally, this measure could result in unknown, but probably minor, local and state costs for enforcement and prosecution of individuals charged with the new animal confinement offense. These costs would be partially offset by revenue from the collection of misdemeanor fines."
Trapping Practices.  Bans Use of Specified Traps and Animal Poisons.  Initiative Statute.,Proposition 4,1998,General,57.5,"Prohibits trapping fur-bearing or nongame mammals with specified traps.  Prohibits commerce in fur or animals so trapped.  Generally prohibits steel-jawed leghold traps on mammals.  Prohibits use of specified poisons on animals.
[S]"
Wildlife Protection. Initiative Statute,Proposition 117,1990,Primary,52.4,"Establishes Habitat Conservation Fund. Transfers $30 million to Fund annually from existing environmental funds and General Fund. Monies from Fund appropriated to Wildlife Conservation Board; Coastal, Tahoe, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancies; state and local parks programs. Funds to be used principally for acquisition of deer and mountain lion habitat; rare and endangered species habitat. Remaining funding for wetlands; riparian and aquatic habitat; open space; other environmental purposes. Prohibits taking of mountain lions unless for protection of life, livestock or other property. Permit for taking required, but prohibits use of poison, leg-hold or metal-jawed traps and snares.

Summary of Legislative Analyst's estimate of net state and local government fiscal impact: For 1990-91, approximately $18 million from Unallocated Account in Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund and $12 million from General Fund will be transferred to the Habitat Conservation Fund, unless Legislature makes transfers from other funds. In subsequent years, General Fund transfers may increase if sales of cigarettes and tobacco products decline. Estimated annual costs of managing acquired properties could exceed $1 million, supported by sources other than Habitat Conservation Fund.
[S]"
"Wildlife, Coastal, And Park Land Conservation Bond Act.",Proposition 70,1988,Primary,65.1,"This act authorizes a general obligation bond issue of seven hundred seventy-six million dollars ($776,000,000) to provide funds for acquisition, development, rehabilitation, protection, or restoration of park, wildlife, coastal, and natural lands in California including lands supporting unique or endangered plants or animals. Funds from bond sales would be administered primarily by or through California Department of Parks and Recreation, Wildlife Conservation Board, and State Coastal Conservancy with funds made available to other state and local agencies and nonprofit organizations. Contains provisions in event other conservation bond acts are enacted.

Summary of Legislative Analyst's estimate of net state and local government fiscal impact: Assuming all the bonds are sold at 7.5 percent interest and state repays the principal and interest over 20 years, the overall cost of repayment would be about $1.4 billion. To the extent these bonds increase amount state borrows, state and local governments may pay more interest on other bond programs. State income taxes could be reduced to the extent California taxpayers invest in these tax-free bonds instead of other taxable investments.

Prohibits use of leghold traps and snares.

The proposed law would prohibit the use, setting, manufacture, or possession of any trap to capture fur-bearing mammals, except common mouse and rat traps, nets, and box or cage traps that confine a whole animal without grasping any part of it.  Traps designed to grip an animal's body or body part, such as steel jaw leghold traps, padded leghold traps, and snares, would be prohibited.  Federal and state health officials could use such traps in case of a threat to human health or safety.  Where a property owner had reasonably tried but failed to correct an animal problem on the property using a legal trap, the owner could apply for and the state Director of Fisheries and Wildlife could issue a permit to use a prohibited type of trap, except a leghold trap, for up to 30 days to correct the problem.

The proposed law would eliminate the requirement that five members of the state Fisheries and Wildlife Board have held sporting licenses in the state for five consecutive years and that four members represent fishing, hunting, and trapping interests.

Limit the Bear Hunting Season and Prohibit the Use of Bait and Dogs to Hunt Bear,Proposal D,1996,General,38.6,"Proposal D would enact a statute prohibiting the use of bait or dogs to chase or hunt bears in Michigan.  It also would make it unlawful to take bear by any means from March 1 through August 31, and during deer, bobcat, or racoon season if baiting or hunting with dogs is permitted for those game species (Under present hunting restrictions, this would limit bear season to September 1 through September 30.).  People convicted of violating the law would forfeit their hunting license for three years for their first offense, and be permanently prohibited from obtaining a hunting license if convicted a second time.

Current Michigan Bear Management
According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), there are an estimated 12,000 black bears in the state, with 1,522 harvested through hunting last year.  Sine 1990, the MDNR has managed the bear population through the establishment of harvest quotas for each of 10 bear management zones, and the issuance of licenses based on anticipated hunter ""success rates.""  In 1995, over 25,000 hunters applied for a bear license, and 5,600 licenses were issued via a lottery system.  Hunting season is limited to September 10 through October 26, and hunters are not allowed to shoot cubs, or sows with cubs.

In Michigan, 80% of bear hunters set out bait to attract bears, and 15% use dogs to track down and tree a bear.  Both of these methods have a 30% success rate.  The remaining 5% of bear hunters use stalking methods, with an estimated 3% to 5% success rate in Michigan.

Impact of Proposal D
Michigan bear hunters would be required to use stalking methods to harvest bear.  The MDNR would continue to monitor the bear population through management zones,b ut probably would increase the number of licenses issued to reflect the lower success rate.  (For example, if the desired harvest were 1,500 bears, the DNR would need to issue 30,000 to 50,000 licenses to reach that goal, assuming a 3% to 5% sucess rate.)  The MDNR also could expand the proposed bear hunting season by prohibiting bait or dogs during portions of deer, bobcat, or racoon season; increase harvest by allowing the taking of sows and cubs; or control the population through destruction of bears by agency employees and contractual bounty hunting.

Proponents of this proposal claim that the use of dogs for bear hunting increases trespass complaints on private property, and that the use of either bait or dogs to hunt bear is not ethical.  Opponents claim that the use of bait and/or dogs allows for more careful selection of the bear during the hunting process, and that the stalking method is not effective in Michigan's swampy bear habitat.

According to wildlife biologists, bear nuisance problems occur due to development pressure in bear habitats, homeowner practices, and the available natural food supply.  Opponents of the proposal claimt hat it will result in insufficient harvest of black bears, increase their population, and create more problems in this area.  Proponents point to other states that have increased nuisance problems in spite of increased bear harvests, and claim that the two issues are unrelated.

Other States
Of the 26 states with bear hunting, 10 allow the use of bait, 18 allow the use of dogs, and eight allow the use of both bait and dogs.  In Colorado (which banned the use of bait and dogs in 1992), the number of bear harvested has not changed significantly, but the number of bear hunters increased by 86%.  New York prohibited the use of dogs in 1990, but has limited data on its impact.  At present, this initiative is on the ballot in Oregon, Idaho, Washington, and Massachusetts.

Passage of Proposals D and G
Proposal D is on the ballot as a result of petition signatures collected by a Michigan citizen organization.  If a majority of the electors cast ""yes"" votes on Proposal D, it will be enacted into law.  If the law is enacted, it cannot be repealed or amended by the Legislature except with a three-fourths vote.

Proposal G is on the ballot as a result of Public Act 377 of 1996 (Senate Bill 1033), which provides that Public Act 377 cannot take effect unless it is approved by a majority of the electors.  If a majority of the electors cast ""yes"" votes on Proposal G, it will amend the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act.  It could be amended at any time by a majority vote of the Legislature.

In the event that both Proposal D and Proposal G are approved, the proposal with the higher number of votes will take precedence if there is a conflict between the language of the proposals.

It also increases the nonresident big game combination license fee from $628 to $897 and the nonresident deer combination license fee from $328 to $527. It provides for future adjustments of these fees for inflation. The initiative allocates a share of the proceeds from these nonresident hunting license fees to provide hunting access and preserve and restore habitat.

I-161 increases state revenues over the next four years by an estimated $700,000 annually for hunting access and an estimated $1.5 million annually for habitat preservation and restoration, assuming that all nonresident hunting licenses are sold. It also increases general nonresident hunting license revenues by inflation."
Game Farm Reform,I-143,2000,General,51.4,"Initiative Statute
This initiative would amend state law to prohibit all new alternative livestock ranches, also known as game farms.

They would also be prohibited from allowing shooting of game farm animals for any type of fee.  The proposal also repeals provisions of the law concerning applications for expansion of game farms.  If approved by voters, the measure would take effect immediately.

This measure would eliminate $104,000 in annual costs of review of game farm applications and expansions, as well as $3,850 yearly revenues from application fees.  Abolishing fee shooting may force closure of some game farms, which could result in less revenue to the state and lower overall regulation costs.

Revising outfitter and hunting licensing,I-136,1998,General,44.0,"State law reserves approximately 7,800 outfitter-sponsored licenses for out-of-state hunters each year:  5,500 licenses entitle the nonresidents to fish and to hunt birds, deer and elk, while the remaining 2,300 exclude the elk tag.  Nonresident hunters are guaranteed this license if they agree to purchase it at market rate and use the services of a Montana-licensed outfitter.  This initiative would eliminate the requirement that the nonresident use an outfitter to obtain these licenses.  However, these licenses would still be set at the market rate.  This initiative would not affect other resident or nonresident hunting and fishing licenses.  The fiscal impacts are difficult to project.  Increasing the group of nonresident hunters eligible for the guaranteed license will increase demand, forcing an increase in price to stay within the statutory quotas.  Eliminating the ""outfitter set-aside"" will have a negative impact on the outfitting business in Montana.

The measure prohibits wholesalers, canners and buyers from buying or receiving salmon, steelhead or any other fish taken with a gillnet or tangle net by non-tribal commercial fishers in Oregon inland waters.

The measure invalidates all Oregon Columbia River commercial gillnet and tangle net permits, and requires the State Fish and Wildlife Commission to adopt rules that allow persons who currently hold the permits to obtain a permit to use seines or fixed fishing gear to take salmon from the Columbia River for commercial purposes.

The measure requires the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission to ensure: that the percentages of the total state, non-tribal Columbia River salmon harvest landed in recreational fisheries are not reduced below 2007 - 2011 averages; that permitted seines or fixed fishing gear minimize mortality to endangered salmon, steelhead and other nontarget species through sorting and live release.

The measure specifies that its provisions do not affect the Columbia River Compact or fishing management agreements between the United States, Indian tribes and states. The measure also specifies that its provisions do not affect any tribal fishing rights, or the use of gillnets or any other fishing gear pursuant to any tribal fishing rights.

The measure removes Oregon Columbia River commercial fishers from the Commercial Fishery Permit Board. Currently those fishers have three positions on the board."

Animal Trapping,Initiative Measure 713,2000,General,54.6,"Initiative Statute
Explanatory Statement by Attorney General:  This measure would make it a gross misdemeanor to use or authorize the use of any steel-jawed leghold trap, neck snare, or other body-gripping trap to capture any mammal for recreation or commerce in fur. ""Body-gripping trap"" would mean a trap that grips an animal's body or body part, and would include, among others, steel-jawed leghold traps, padded-jaw leghold traps, Conibear traps, neck snares, and nonstrangling foot snares. Cage and box traps, suitcase-type live beaver traps, and common rat and mouse traps would not be considered ""body-gripping traps.""

It would be unlawful to buy, sell, barter, or otherwise exchange the raw fur of a mammal or a mammal that has been trapped in this state with a steel-jawed leghold trap or any other body-gripping trap. It would also be unlawful to use or authorize the use of body-gripping traps for any ""animal,"" which is defined as any nonhuman vertebrate.

For limited purposes, the director of fish and wildlife could grant special permits for the use of Conibear traps in water, padded leghold traps, and nonstrangling type foot snares. The director could permit these types of traps to be used to protect people from threats to their health and safety, or after making a written finding that an animal problem could not be abated by the use of nonlethal control tools. The director could also issue permits for the conduct of legitimate wildlife research. The director could authorize the use of certain traps by state employees or agents to protect threatened or endangered species, if that is the only practical means. Even with any of the above permits, the trapper could not lawfully sell the fur of the animal trapped.

The measure would also make it a gross misdemeanor to poison or attempt to poison any animal using sodium fluoroacetate (also known as Compound 1080) or using sodium cyanide.

Violations could result in criminal penalties in addition to revocation of trapping licenses. Persons with multiple convictions would be ineligible to receive any more trapping licenses."

Commercial Fishing Restrictions,Initiative 696,1999,General,39.5,"Explanatory Statement

The Law As It Presently Exists
Commercial fishing in Washington waters is regulated by a number of laws codified primarily in Title 75 of the Revised Code of Washington. There is no law generally prohibiting commercial fishing with nets or troll lines, but existing laws do specify whether and where certain types of gear can be used. For example, there are laws that prohibit salmon fishing with nets in the Pacific Ocean within three miles of shore; prohibit bottom trawling in much of Puget Sound; and allow salmon gill nets only in Puget Sound, Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, and the lower Columbia River. Commercial net fishing in fresh water is prohibited, except in the Columbia River.

Annual commercial fishing licenses (net or troll) specify what species of fish may be taken, what type of fishing gear may be used, and in what geographic area the fishing may occur. Additional restrictions may be incorporated in specific licenses issued. The number of commercial licenses that are issued may be limited in accordance with a license limitation program.

Violations of the commercial fishing laws are Class C felonies, gross misdemeanors, or misdemeanors, depending on the nature of each violation.

As a matter of federal law, state licensing requirements and gear restrictions ordinarily do not apply to the exercise of treaty fishing rights.

The Effect of the Proposed Measure Should It Be Approved Into Law

This measure would prohibit commercial net fishing in fresh or marine waters within Washington state, except tribal fishing conducted under valid treaty rights. The measure would also prohibit nontribal commercial troll fishing in Washington state waters.

The following types of gear and licenses would be specifically prohibited: purse seine, gill net, baitfish purse seine, dogfish set net, food fish drag seine, food fish trawl (Puget Sound and non-Puget Sound), herring drag seine, herring gill net, baitfish lampara, herring purse seine, Columbia river smelt, smelt dip bag net, whiting (Puget sound), shrimp trawl (Puget Sound and non-Puget Sound), emerging commercial fishery licenses and spawn on kelp. The following types of gear and licenses would still be permitted: reef net, crab pots, shrimp pots, herring lampara, and herring dip bag net.

Engaging in fishing in violation of this measure would be a class C felony.

The measure would not apply to treaty fishing."
